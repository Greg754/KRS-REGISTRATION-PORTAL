        Monthly Membership Plans:
        Payments are due on the 1st of
        each month. Payments not made
        by the 5th of each month incur a
        $ 15 late fee; skater may be excluded from classes.
        Cancellation Policy: To cancel a
        monthly membership, skater must
        notify us in writing 15 days before
        the next month starts. If not cancelled by the 15th of the month,
        skater is responsible for the next
        month’s membership rate in full.
        If someone cancels their plan and
        then wishes to re-enroll, they must
        pay the registration fee again.
        All You Can Skate: Due to the
        value of All You Can Skate, if a
        contract is cancelled before the end
        of any month, full payment for one
        additional month is required by
        the 5th of that month, and there
        are no skating privileges during
        that additional month.
        Direct Debit: Direct debit is available. Declined payments must be
        remedied by the 5th of the month
        to avoid a late fee. To opt out of direct debit, bill must be paid at least
        5 days in advance of the 1st.
        Missed Classes: No refunds for
        missed classes, but one make-up
        is allowed during every 8 weeks of
        classes.
        Refunds for medical reasons must
        be validated by a medical practitioner’s written statement.

        Card or Key Tag must be presented
        and scanned each visit and each
        session attended.

        Chalet Ice Rinks, Inc. (Ice Chalet) is committed to conducting its skating programs and activities in a safe manner
        and holds the safety of its participants in high regard. We strive to reduce risks and insist that all participants follow
        safety rules and policies that are designed to protect the participants’ safety.  However, there is an inherent risk of
        injury when choosing to participate in ice skating activities, and participants and their parents/guardians must recognize this fact. As a parent/guardian, you are solely responsible for determining if you or your minor child/ward is
        physically fit and/or adequately skilled for ice skating activities.  If the participant is pregnant, disabled in any way,
        or has recently suffered an illness, injury, or impairment, it is advisable to consult a physician before undertaking
        any such physical activity.
        WARNING OF RISK: Ice skating is intended to challenge and engage the physical, mental, and emotional resources of the participant.  Regardless of careful and proper preparation, instruction, medical advice, conditioning, and
        equipment, there is still a risk of serious injury, including but not limited to head injury, neck or back injury, wrist and
        ankle fractures, and other orthopedic injuries to limbs and joints.  Individuals who have a history of these problems
        should seek the advice of their physician before engaging in activities that may aggravate pre-existing problems. It is
        impossible to foresee all hazards and dangers.  The very nature of ice skating is risky, including but not limited to slips
        and falls, colliding with other skaters of varying degrees of skill (including being struck from behind), tripping, cuts
        from skate blades, ill-fitting skates, horseplay, carelessness, poor technique, poor conditioning, rule violations, striking
        a stationary object, failure in supervision, premises defects outside the rink, and all other risks inherent in ice skating.  
        It must be recognized that it is impossible for the Ice Chalet to guarantee absolute safety.
        CONCUSSIONS: A concussion is a type of traumatic brain injury that changes the way the brain normally
        works.  A concussion is caused by a bump, blow or jolt to the head or body that causes the head and brain to move
        rapidly back and forth. Even a “ding,” “getting your bell rung” or what seems to be a mild bump or blow to the
        head can be serious. Signs and symptoms of concussion can show up right after the injury or may not appear or
        be noticed until days or weeks after the injury. If an athlete reports one or more symptoms of concussion listed
        below after a bump, blow or jolt to the head or body, s/he should be kept out of play the day of the injury and until
        a health care provider says s/he is symptom-free and it’s OK to return to play.
        u Signs of a Concussion: Appears dazed or stunned; Headache or “pressure” in head; Is confused about
         assignment or position Nausea or vomiting; Forgets an instruction; Balance problems or dizziness; Is
         unsure of game, score, or opponent; Double or blurry vision; Moves clumsily; Sensitivity to light; Answers
         questions slowly; Sensitivity to noise; Loses consciousness, even briefly.
        u Symptoms of a Concussion: Feeling sluggish, hazy, foggy, or groggy; Shows mood, behavior, or personality
         changes; Concentration or memory problems; Can’t recall events prior to hit or fall; Confusion; Can’t recall
         events after hit or fall; Just not “feeling right” or “feeling down”.
        Concussions affect people differently.  While most athletes with a concussion recover quickly and fully, some
        will have symptoms that last for days, or even weeks.  A more serious concussion can last for months or longer.  
        If an athlete has a concussion, his/her brain needs time to heal. While an athlete’s brain is still healing, s/he is much
        more likely to have another concussion. Repeat concussions can increase the time it takes to recover. In rare cases,
        repeat concussions in young athletes can result in brain swelling or permanent damage to their brain. They can
        even be fatal.  After a concussion, returning to sports and school is a gradual process that should be carefully managed and monitored by a health care professional. A letter from a health care professional authorizing the skater’s
        return to skating is required by Tennessee law.
        PHOTOS & VIDEOS: The Ice Chalet takes photos and videos of participants in classes, during special events, public sessions, and in the lobby and party rooms. By signing this waiver, you are giving permission to the Ice Chalet to
        use these photos and videos in marketing programs, brochures, web sites, social media, and other media.
        COVID-19/WELLNESS CONCERNS: Even with many precautions in place, the Ice Chalet cannot eliminate all
        risks associated with COVID-19 and other communicable diseases. I/we understand that by choosing to use this
        facility, I/we are assuming the risk that our I and/or my child may contract COVID-19 or another communicable
        disease despite the Ice Chalet’s best efforts to provide a clean and safe environment.
        SUMMARY -- WAIVER & RELEASE: Please be aware that in signing up and participating in this program/activ- ity, you will be expressly assuming the risk and legal liability and waiving and releasing all claims for injuries, dam- ages, or loss which you or your minor child/ward might sustain as a result of participating in any and all activities
        associated with this program/activity.
        I recognize and acknowledge that there are certain risks of physical injury to participants in this program/activity,
        and I voluntarily agree to assume the full risk of any and all injuries, damages, or loss, regardless of severity, that I
        and/or my minor child/ward may sustain as a result of said participation.  I further agree to waive and relinquish
        all claims I and/or my minor child/ward may have (or accrue to me or my child/ward) as a result of participating in
        this program/activity against the Ice Chalet, including its owners, officers, agents, directors, stockholders, volunteers, and employees. 
        I further agree to defend, indemnify, and hold the Ice Chalet harmless against any and all liability, loss, expense, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, or claims of injury or damages arising out of my or minor child/ward’s participation in this activity/program, but only in proportion to and to the extent such liability loss, expense, attorneys’ fees,
        or claims for injuries or damages are caused by or result from my or my child/ward’s acts or omissions.
        I have read and fully understand the above information, warning of risk, photo/video policy, assumption of risk,
        and waiver and release of all claims, and indemnification agreement. If registering online or via fax, my online or
        facsimile signature or clickwrap shall substitute for and have the same legal effect as an original form signature.  
        I understand that I and/or my minor child/ward skate at my/his/her own risk and hereby release the Ice Chalet,
        its owners, and all personnel from any and all liability.
